# Zenmigo UI Drafting Process

It has been an incredible year of constant development. Zenmigo was started as "WebSwift" and just a drawing done out of pure frustration and boredom... Now, my team and I have built incredible software recognizable by thousands (and growing...):

## First Step - Pencil Drawing
